# Welcome and thank you for participating!

Thank you for taking part in our recruitment process. This assignment is meant to evaluate the proficiency of full-stack engineers. During this technical assignment you will have to perform thee tasks based on a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# What is expected from you?

- The first task is a code review. You will have to add comments and suggestions as if you were reviewing your peer's code. Make sure to read the section **_"Code Quality Guidelines"_** to understand which standards you should follow to perform the code review.

- The second task is to refactor the code according to your own review comments. 

- The third and last task is to add a new feature into the existing repository.

## Tasks in the Issues section

Your tasks can be found in the issues section. See tab: Issues. Each task has its own acceptance criteria. Read those carefully!

We will review your work only after all three tasks are completed. If anything is unclear or you are unsure about something, please make an assumption and write it down in the task.

## Focus on best practices

Your code structure should follow design best practices and our evaluation will focus primarily on your ability to follow good design principles and less on the correctness and completeness of algorithms. If you pass to the next recruiting phase, you will have the opportunity to discuss your technical choices during a tech interview.

## Time limits

The tasks are designed to be completed in **around 2-4 hours.**
**Please DO NOT spend too much time on it.** If you haven't completed the task, simply submit it as-is. We will value more the intention, quality and best design practices than a production-ready code.

# Code Quality Guidelines

We want you to ensure the code merged is of the highest possible quality, meaning it is:

1. Maintainable:
   - Well-structured
   - Easily extendable
   - Reusable (where applicable)
   - Follows the standards
2. Bug free:
   - Corner cases covered
   - Test automation
3. Smart:
   - Expressive/concise
   - Declarative
   - Making the best of OOP/FP worlds, i.e.:
     - Follows SOLID
     - Applies immutability & purity (where applicable)
     - Composition over inheritance
4. Accessible:
   - Proper semantics
   - Descriptive naming conventions
   - Readable by screen readers

# Ready for review?

You should communicate to your YouGov contact that you are ready for getting your technical exercise reviewed. We will review your work only after all 3 tasks are completed. We will be in touch very soon to give you feedback.
